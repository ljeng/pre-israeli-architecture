# Jerusalem in the Crusades

### The Transformation of Jerusalem

Jerusalem didn't emerge as a central spiritual hub for Islam. Jerusalem's association with jihad waned by the Ayyubid period's end. Its geopolitical significance declined. The First Crusade conquered Jerusalem. Four main Crusader armies left Europe in August 1096. They arrived at Jerusalem on June 7, 1099. The city was besieged starting from July 13. Attacks on the walls commenced on July 14. The Crusaders breached the northern wall by noon on July 15. They collapsed Muslim defenses. Most Crusaders returned to Europe following the conquest. They left only a small number of pilgrims to settle in the Holy Land. The Crusaders' massacre changed the population composition. The Crusaders killed Jews and banned them from the city. The Crusaders initially emptied Jerusalem of inhabitants. Many houses were abandoned. Exemption from customs and improved roads boosted trade. The city became a major market for pilgrims' imported goods.

### Saladin's Conquest

Saladin's Muslim army conquered almost all Kingdom of Jerusalem citadels following the Battle of Hattin on July 4, 1187. Saladin's forces surrounded Jerusalem on September 17. He personally led the siege on September 20. Christians realized the futility of defense. They negotiated a conditional surrender. They signed a contract. They surrendered the city to Saladin. The rich saved themselves. But the poor were unable to pay the ransom. Thousands of Christians were released without compensation. ~15,000 were left destitute. Saladin's conquest shocked Europe. It precipitated the Third Crusade. He destroyed Crusader additions and removed statues and altars. He reverted the Dome of the Rock to a mosque. The Church of Saint Mary became a hospital. The Church of St. Anne became a madrasa. He destroyed other churches. He used stones for repairs. Saladin enhanced the city's fortifications. He prepared for potential Christian attacks. Local Christians mainly belonged to the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox Churches. They remained the city as *dhimmīs*, paying a poll tax. Saladin implemented a *waqf* system to sustain religious institutions in Jerusalem. He linked revenues to assets. The Third Crusade (1190) reversed Hattin's effects. It retook the Kingdom of Jerusalem, and reclaimed the city. Richard the Lionheart led the Crusaders. They reached Jerusalem after the successful Battle of Arsufbut but decided not to conquer it. Negotiation produced the Treaty of Jaffa in 1192. It granted Christians freedom for pilgrimages. Jerusalem lost its status as the religious center. It became a provincial city. The city suffered devastation during the Fifth Crusade. The Ayyubid ruler Al-Mu'azzam systematically destroyed fortifications. Al-Mu'azzam feared a Crusader retake. He ordered the systematic destruction of fortifications. Much of the population fled. Jerusalem became a city with reduced inter-religious strife. Government buildings and holy sites survived. But the city underwent substantial destruction.

### The Fall of Jerusalem in the Sixth Crusade

Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II led the Sixth Crusade. It began in 1228. Frederick faced divisions within his army. He regained Bethlehem and Nazareth in February 1229 without resistance despite this. A ten-year truce's terms were unacceptable to the Patriarch of Jerusalem, placing the city under interdict. Frederick crowned himself in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in March, but Jerusalem wasn't truly reincorporated into the kingdom, which was ruled from Acre, due to the interdict. The treaty with the Ayyubids was set to expire in 1239, and plans for a new crusade led by Frederick fell through. He was excommunicated again in 1239. Other European nobles, Count of Champagne and King of Navarre, took up the cause. Theobald was elected crusade leader. The Ayyubids were divided between Isma'il in Damascus and Dawud in Kerak. Al-Kamil, who had occupied Damascus in 1238, died exacerbating divisions within the Ayyubid territories. Ayyub hired the Khwarazmians. They sacked Jerusalem in 1244, leaving it in ruins. The Khwarazmians faced the Frankish-Syrian coalition in October 1244. The Egyptian army under Baibars destroyed it. Ayyub had reoccupied most of the territory conceded in 1239. He gained control of Damascus by 1247.

### Mamluk Rule

Historical reports conflict. They depend on the historian's nationality. Rumors in Europe falsely claimed that the Mongols had captured Jerusalem and would return it to the Crusaders. But modern historians generally agree that these rumors were baseless. The Mongols never attempted to incorporate Jerusalem into their administrative system during raids and conquest. There's consensus among historians even if there were raids. Pope Nicholas IV negotiated an agreement with the Mamluk sultan. He allowed Latin clergy in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Pope Nicolas sent a Franciscan friar group to Jerusalem by Pope Nicholas, King Robert of Sicily's donation in 1300 to the Sultan allowed the Franciscans to have the Sion Church, Mary Chapel in the Holy Sepulchre, and the Nativity Cave. Mamluk sultans visited Jerusalem and endowed new buildings. They encouraged Muslim settlement and expanded mosques. Sultan Baibars renewed the Muslim alliance with the Jews during his reign. He established sanctuaries for Moses and Salih to attract Jewish pilgrims during Christian Easter.

Nachmanides made *aliyah* in 1267. He established the Ramban Synagogue in the Old City.

The city had limited political power despite these developments. Mamluks considered it a place of exile for out-of-favor officials.

# Contemporary Maps Enhance Understanding of Crusader States

Crusader castles are historical sites that attract tourists. Contemporary maps that show their locations in relation to modern cities and roads are very practical for visitors who are planning trips and need to navigate the current transportation networks. Using contemporary maps maintains consistency with other geographical information. Users can relate easily to the locations. They can understand the locations' modern-day settings. This enhances public education about historical sites. People associate these structures with their present-day locations and understand the historical events in a modern context.
