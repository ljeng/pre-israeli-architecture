# Mamluk Architecture

### Power

Architecture in the Mamluk period was a resource-intensive activity that required strong  urban patrons. I note architectural projects, whether monuments or entire cities, for their money and manpower investment. Architecture and monumental buildings were the royal class' pursuit. Chroniclers wrote about the ruling class' deeds including their architectural projects and how they served pietistic functions. Earlier Islamic historiography had some references to architectural projects, but Mamluk authors during the Mamluk period showed increased attention to architecture. They produced more numerous references than their predecessors. Mamluk authors described architecture in mundane terms rather than using aesthetic terms. They rarely used terms like "beautiful" or "pleasing", and they focused on practical aspects rather than formal qualities. Mamluk authors didn't engage in formal investigations with an aesthetic interest in buildings' symbolic significance. Philosophical ideas occasionally seeped into Mamluk texts but professional architectural terms were notably absent. Mamluk authors' intellectual curiosity or scholarly training didn't extend to formal investigations. References to monumentality in Mamluk sources had an ideological purpose. Buildings were sometimes compared to rival Islamic powers' structures for their massiveness and grandeur. Mamluk authors showed a historical awareness, comparing contemporary buildings to famous monuments of mythical pasts including the pre-Islamic period. Buildings' socioeconomic contexts concerned legal Mamluk sources.

*Waqf: a charitable endowment under Islamic law*

Descriptions detailed cost. Waqf documents' language influenced buildings' descriptions in historical sources. Many authors moved between legal and historical writing, and some incorporated parts of waqf documents into their historical texts. Historical reporting in Mamluk sources relied on literary tropes, poetic quotations and reported conversations. This "literarized" history added a novelistic and enticing quality to the accounts.

### Social Influence

The literati controlled various services and maintained authority through mediation and arbitration but weren't social change agents. The social groups depended on the Mamluk military elite for their livelihood. They were employed to administer systems in the sultanate. These groups were excluded from political decision-making. They were under constant check with the threat of confiscation and arrest despite their importance. Mamluk patrons including sultans like al-Nāșir Muhammad and Qāytbaāy used architecture. They reinforced the expression of social positions. Mamluk sources treated architecture based on the authors' personal inclination, intellectual structures, and the readers' preferences. Mamluk patrons' wishes influenced authors in providing building projects' detailed records. ‘Izz al-Dīn Muhammad ibn ‘Alī Ibn Shaddād introduced a biographical innovation in Baybars I's annals, listing all the building projects systematically in a separate section. This innovation started a convention in Mamluk princely biographies of comprehensiveness in recording building projects. Other biographical accounts didn't replicate Ibn Shaddād's attention to space organization in Baybars' biography. This detailed recording of architectural projects became a convention in later chroniclers' accounts, although none reached the same level of detail as Ibn Shaddād.

### Evolution in Perspective in *masālik wa-al-mamālik* Books

Buildings' forms didn't traditionally concern the *masālik wa-al-mamālik* books. Still, in the fourteenth century, they started incorporating architectural descriptions and discussion of urban development. The work of al-‘Umarī, whose *Masālik al-Abșār* features detailed topographic descriptions of holy sites, presenting buildings sociopolitically. al-Maqrīzī composed *Al-Mawā‘iz wa-al-I‘tibār bi-Dhikr al-Khițaț* between 1417 and 1439/40. al-Maqrīzī's work remains exceptional in its scope, but later historians produced books on urban history, showing some awareness of architecture's sociocultural role.

### Interpretation from Elite Perspectives

An architectural production was substantial in its attempts to display social status. The Mamluk period witnessed it. Modern architectural scholars interpret this architecture. Their interpretations have certain methodological biases. I critique the common practice of starting the analysis with the architecture itself, reading inscriptions for clues about patronage. These sources don't necessarily reflect common attitudes toward architecture in Mamluk society at large. The oversight of this fact has led to sometimes conflicting interpretations that rest on thin historical conjecture. The sources, especially the *masālik wa-al-mamālik* books must be understood within their elite authors' collective background and social manipulations. The educated classes' readers viewed architecture as a tool of personal propaganda, financial gain, a source of complaint, and possibly entertaining anecdotes. I examine these common sources' peculiarities. I interpret architecture's meaning for Mamluk society. The sources mainly reveal the educated elite's perspective, and architecture was a tool for personal purposes for this influential group. The general population's voices are absent from the sources. This indicates a bias in scholarly assumptions about Mamluk ruling class patrons in understanding Mamluk architecture.
